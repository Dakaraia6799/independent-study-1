React.js is a JavaScript Library for building user interfaces. A user interface is how a person interacts with a program. Therefore, in the MVC pattern this would be the view. Another JavaScript library that I am familiar with and have used before is p5js. The developers of this program are Facebook, Instagram, and other individuals. React.js was first released in March of 2013. The main reason why people use this is to provide speed and simplicity to large web-applications.
